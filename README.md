# Brainster-Blog
Brainster-Blog is my second project. This project compared to the first one was bigger and more challenging. By the time I finished with this project, I've learned a lot about JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX on the Brainster Academy. This project also has a second version of it made with hash change method in JavaScript (I haven't posted the second version because it would have problems on Netlify when the hash is changing). If you are interested in checking out the second version I will leave a link down below for you to head out to my account on GitLab where you can also all my projects and coding challenges.
